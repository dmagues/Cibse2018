\textit{Context: }Integration of agile software development process (ASDP) with user-centred design (UCD) has awakened the interest of researchers during the last decade. However, to the best of our knowledge a formal procedure to incorporate techniques to evaluate usability into ASDP has not been reported in the literature. \textit{Aim: } To identify usability techniques related to evaluation activities which are being incorporated into ASDP and practicalities of its use. \textit{Method: }Based on primary studies of a previous systematic mapping study about application of usability techniques in ASDP, we conducted an analysis of such techniques through a compiled catalog of usability techniques made by researchers of Software Engineering. Finally, we determined the procedure performed for the application of each technique into ASDP. \textit{Results: }The agile community show great interest in the incorporation of usability evaluation techniques. However, there is no consensus on how to apply these techniques as a formal and systematic way. We identified four evaluation techniques that are the most used in ASDP: Usability Test, Heuristic Evaluation, Thinking Aloud and Focus Group. \textit{Conclusions:} The analysis of evaluation usability techniques and its use provided us an overview of activities performed to incorporate such techniques into ASDP and identify specific techniques that are being incorporated.
