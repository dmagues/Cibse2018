pages={24-32}, 
abstract={Agile software engineering and user-centered design are two important development processes for ensuring that an application has good user experience. However, integrating these two different processes into a single Agile-UX approach remains difficult. We performed a systematic mapping study to identify relevant research and understand what the field of Agile-UX looks like at present. This mapping discovered that there were only a few evaluation and validation papers published to date, so we performed a review of these papers to better understand the recommendations of these types of papers. Based on this, we are able both to provide a discussion of common trends in these papers that should be of interest to practitioners and to identify gaps in existing literature that indicate strong opportunities for future work.},
